During each phase you’re going to have to answer some questions. Every decision you make has an impact on your score, which consists of three attributes associated with you as a researcher:\n\nFunding (𝔐)\nEthics (𝔈)\nReputation (ℜ)\n\nBy the end of the game you’ll learn about the different forms of publishing. For this, it is very important that you keep track of your stats. You can either write it down during the game or leave the answer of your choice open and sum up in the end in the end."
